# MCBTE

 MCBTE solves linearized Boltzmann transport equation for phonons in three-dimensional domain using variance-reduces Monte Carlo simulation.






The code is tested on Matlab/R2019b and compatibility with older version is not guaranteed.
Example problem are provided in the directory 'example_input_files'.

To run any example, copy and place the source code in the same directory as the input files. After that, run 'BTE_solution_3D.m' in MATLAB.

To simulate example problem in 'nanomesh_accumu_2THz', a small modification is done in 'BTE_solution_3D.m'. The modified file is provided alongwith the input files in the same directory.
